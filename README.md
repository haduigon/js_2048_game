- All numbers move in the chosen direction until all empty cells are filled.

- Two identical cells merge into a doubled number.

- A move is valid if at least one cell changes.

- After each move, a 2 or 4 appears in a random empty cell, with a 10% chance of being a 4.

# Reflection

Building a todo app in React JS will enhance your skills in managing asynchronous data with Promises. Set up your project, create components for tasks, and fetch data using Fetch API or Axios. Store tasks in local state, Redux, or local storage and update the UI using async/await. This project will improve your understanding of state management and error handling in React.
